1. We modeled Tuberculosis in a population of 10,000 people.
    Population size: 10,000
    Percent vaccinated: 20%
    Initial infected: 25
    Virus:
        Name: Tuberculosis
        Mortality Rate: 70%
        Reproductive Rate: 30%
2. At the end of time step 2, 6,161 people were infected. This is about
    61.6% of the population of 10,000.
3. By the end of the final step, step 4, 5574 people were dead. This is
    about 55.7% of the population of 10,000.
4. A person was potentially saved from infection by being vaccinated
    395,385 times during our simulation. This further protected others in
    the population by stopping the virus from spreading. Thus, with a high
    enough vaccination rate, members of the population could be safe from
    infection without being vaccinated. In real life, this effect (herd
    immunity) can help to keep people healthy who legitimately cannot get
    vaccines, such as the immunocompromised. That is why it is so important
    for those who are able to get vaccinated.
